We are building the "Roam\_Bot," an Autonomous Indoor Rover designed to navigate complex environments without GPS. The Roam\_Bot will use multiple sensors, including LIDAR, Sonar, Time-of-Flight (ToF), accelerometers, and gyroscopes. These devices will gather data to make real time navigation decisions. The primary task of the Roam\_Bot will be to map out an indoor area and test various pathfinding algorithms. By evaluating algorithms, we can test their performance in real-world scenarios. By implementing a robust software framework, the Roam\_Bot will process sensor data, identify obstacles, and dynamically adapt its route.

% This is the "What" of the project and it states what will be done to address the problem statement. This section should focus mostly on what your solution is going to be and what it is going to do (i.e., we are going to build an app, robot, device, etc. to perform some task which mitigates the problem). If someone were to ask you \textit{"What are you doing for your senior design project?"}, this is section is basically what you would tell them.
