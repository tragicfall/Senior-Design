% Your introduction should provide a brief overview of the product concept and a reference to the requirement specification and architectural design documents in 1 or 2 paragraphs. The purpose is to provide the reader with the location of relevant background material that lead to the design details presented in this document.

The Roam\_Bot should assist with learning to implement autonomous system software through real test simulations. This will be achieved using actual robotic systems. The overall design is controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which acts as the host connecting the different components of the rover. The first section describes the rover's motion and functionality. The second section entails the interface which allows users to upload their algorithm or manually control the rover. The third section is about the path-finding function, which dictates where the rover can move with the use of LIDAR and other sensors.
