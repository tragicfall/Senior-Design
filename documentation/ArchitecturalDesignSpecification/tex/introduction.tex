%Your introduction should describe your product concept in sufficient detail that the architectural design will be easy to follow. The introduction may include information used in the first sections of your SRS for this purpose. At a minimum, ensure that the product concept, scope and key requirements are described.
The Roam\_Bot should assist with learning to implement autonomous system software through real test simulations. This will be achieved using actual robotic systems. The overall design is controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which acts as the host connecting the different components of the rover. For now, the Raspberry Pi has three sections that connect to it. The first section describes the rover's motion and functionality. The second section entails the interface which allows users to upload their algorithm or manually control the rover. The third section is about the path-finding function, which dictates where the rover can move with the use of LIDAR and other sensors.
