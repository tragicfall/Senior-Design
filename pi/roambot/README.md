Roambot Folder Overview
========================

This folder contains two test programs used to control the microcontroller from the Raspberry Pi 5:

1. **gpio_test** — Uses GPIO-based signaling to control the wheels (legacy method).
2. **serial_test** — Uses serial communication to send commands (current method).

Scripts provided for running tests:
- **gpio.sh** — Runs the GPIO test.
- **serial.sh** — Runs the serial communication test.
