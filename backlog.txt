LiPo:
  1. Design and create a secure mount for the LiPo battery to prevent movement during the bot's operation.
  2. Implement a voltage detection system for the LiPo battery to monitor its charge level (0% - 100%).
     - This could be done using either a separate circuit with an LCD display or integrated with the MCU or Raspberry Pi for real-time monitoring.

DC Motors:
  1. Identify the encoder wire connections for each motor and determine how to interface with them.
  2. Implement a feedback control system on the TM4C RedBoard to adjust motor power, based on the encoder readings, ensuring the motor moves at the desired speed and position.
