% Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. In this section specify anything else that is required for the product to be deemed complete. Include requirements related to customer setup and configuration if not specified in a previous requirement. Add any known requirements related to product architecture/design, such as modularity, extensibility (for future enhancements), or adaptation for a specific programming language. Consider requirements such as portability of your source code to various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix Mac OS, etc.).

The Roam\_Bot will meet various system validation requirements to make certain that it meets all design requirements and specifications. Comprehensive testing will be performed to verify the reliability and accuracy of all components in the system.



\subsection{System Validation}
\subsubsection{Description}
% Description of the Requirement
Validation will ensure that all parts of the robot are functioning independently and together meet the design specifications and performance requirements. This includes testing for durability, software reliability, and safety protocols.

\subsubsection{Source}
% The source of the requirement (e.g. customer, sponsor, specified team member (by name), federal regulation, local laws, CSE Senior Design project specifications, etc.)
Team TLC

\subsubsection{Constraints}
% A detailed description of realistic constraints relevant to this requirement. Economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health \& safety, manufacturability, and sustainability should be discussed as appropriate.
Accuracy: The testing must analyze both hardware and software to ensure the design specifications are met in various environments.\\
Human Interaction: The system should be tested to ensure easy access and intuitive use when being operated by various users.

\subsubsection{Standards}
% A detailed description of any specific standards that apply to this requirement (e.g. \textit{NSTM standard xx.xxx.x. color specifications \cite{Rubin2012}}. Standards exist for practically everything (ATC standard fuses, IEEE 802.15.4 embedded wireless, TLS 1.3 encryption, etc.), so be sure that you research and document which ones will be followed in meeting this requirement.
- ISO 9001 (Quality Sensor Measurement)\\
- IEC 61010 (Human-Computer Interfaces)

\subsubsection{Priority}
% Critical (1)
% High (2)
% Moderate (3)
% Low (4)
% Future (5)
Priority Level: Moderate (3)
